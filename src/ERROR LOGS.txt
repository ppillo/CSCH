Using Sam's Database, With Auto Increment.

Membership

1. Cannot view member types
2. Cannot add new members

Both errors show 'Unknown column'.

It seemed that cakePHP somehow gets the name of the column wrong. attempting to manually fix them.

fixed no 1 by changing column names
fixed no 2 by changing echo $this->Form->input('mtypes._ids', ['options' => $mtypes]); to echo $this->Form->input('mtype._id', ['options' => $mtypes]); 
at templates\members\add.ctp
